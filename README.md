![CI](https://github.com/srehan17/cicd-demo/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)

🚀 **Live Demo**: https://cicd-demo-jpxu.onrender.com/

This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
On every push to `main`, tests run, a Docker image is built, and the app is automatically deployed to the cloud.

## Architecture

- Node.js + Express
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Cloud deployment (Render)
